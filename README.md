Educational Equity Platform
Problem Statement:
Design an online platform that connects students from
underprivileged backgrounds with mentors and educational
resources. The platform should offer virtual tutoring, facilitate
access to scholarship opportunities, and provide a community
forum for peer support and collaboration.
Problem Description:
Students from underprivileged backgrounds face barriers to quality
education, including limited mentorship, inadequate resources, and
a lack of information on financial aid. These challenges hinder their
academic performance and future prospects. The proposed
platform aims to bridge this gap by providing a centralised online
space for these students to connect with mentors, access virtual
tutoring, and find scholarship opportunities. With personalised
mentorship, interactive resources, and a supportive community
forum, the platform will offer tailored support and valuable
connections, empowering students to excel academically and
pursue their goals with confidence.
**Features:
The platform offers personalised academic support through
virtual tutoring, connecting students with qualified tutors who
can address their specific learning needs and help them improve
their understanding of various subjects.
It features a mentor matching system that pairs students with
experienced mentors who provide tailored guidance, advice, and
encouragement, fostering personal and academic growth.
An extensive scholarship database is available, allowing students
to easily access a wide range of financial aid opportunities,
helping to alleviate the financial barriers to higher education.
The application assistance feature guides students through the
often complex college and scholarship application processes,
ensuring they have the tools and resources needed to present
their best selves.
Community forums create a supportive online space where
students can share their experiences, seek advice, collaborate on
projects, and build valuable connections with peers facing similar
challenges.**
